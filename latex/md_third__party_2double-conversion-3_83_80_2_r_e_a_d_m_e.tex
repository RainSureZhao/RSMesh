This project (double-\/conversion) provides binary-\/decimal and decimal-\/binary routines for IEEE doubles.

The library consists of efficient conversion routines that have been extracted from the V8 Java\+Script engine. The code has been refactored and improved so that it can be used more easily in other projects.

There is extensive documentation in {\ttfamily \doxylink{string-to-double_8h_source}{double-\/conversion/string-\/to-\/double.\+h}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{double-to-string_8h_source}{double-\/conversion/double-\/to-\/string.\+h}}. Other examples can be found in {\ttfamily test/cctest/test-\/conversions.\+cc}.\hypertarget{md_third__party_2double-conversion-3_83_80_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Building}{Building}}\label{md_third__party_2double-conversion-3_83_80_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
This library can be built with \href{http://www.scons.org/}{\texttt{ scons}} or \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ cmake}}. The checked-\/in Makefile simply forwards to scons, and provides a shortcut to run all tests\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make
make test
\end{DoxyVerb}

The easiest way to install this library is to use {\ttfamily scons}. It builds the static and shared library, and is set up to install those at the correct locations\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}scons install
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Use the {\ttfamily DESTDIR} option to change the target directory\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}scons DESTDIR=alternative_directory install
\end{DoxyVerb}

To use cmake run {\ttfamily cmake .} in the root directory. This overwrites the existing Makefile.

Use {\ttfamily -\/DBUILD\+\_\+\+SHARED\+\_\+\+LIBS=ON} to enable the compilation of shared libraries. Note that this disables static libraries. There is currently no way to build both libraries at the same time with cmake.

Use {\ttfamily -\/DBUILD\+\_\+\+TESTING=ON} to build the test executable. \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake . -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
make
test/cctest/cctest
\end{DoxyVerb}
