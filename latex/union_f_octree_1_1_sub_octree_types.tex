The class works on suboctree. Most of the resources needed are avaiblable by using \doxylink{class_f_abstract_sub_octree}{FAbstract\+Sub\+Octree}. But when accessing to the leaf we have to use \doxylink{class_f_sub_octree}{FSub\+Octree} or \doxylink{class_f_sub_octree_with_leafs}{FSub\+Octree\+With\+Leafs} depending if we are working on the bottom of the tree.
